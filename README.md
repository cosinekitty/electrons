# Electrons on a Sphere

This is a simulation of mutually repulsive particles confined to the surface of a sphere.
The particles try to get as far apart as possible, but they must always remain on the sphere.
Eventually they settle down into some stable configuration.
The simulation draws matching lines between groups of particles when they settle down
into matching distances.
